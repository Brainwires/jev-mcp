/**
 * The MCP server's ten-second look at the daemon.
 *
 * `SessionStart` starts the daemon, which covers the normal case. This covers
 * the rest: the daemon was killed mid-session, it exited on its idle timer, it
 * crashed, or the user ran `/jev:daemon restart` — which deliberately only
 * stops, because it runs through the Bash tool and a daemon spawned from a
 * sandboxed process would inherit that sandbox. Something has to start the
 * replacement, and the MCP server is the one process in the picture that is
 * already long-lived, already unsandboxed, and already carries the plugin's
 * configuration in its environment.
 *
 * Two rules, both about not being a nuisance:
 *
 * - **Never block the MCP loop.** The interval is `unref`'d, so it cannot keep
 *   the process alive on its own, and one run never overlaps the next. Every
 *   error is swallowed and counted; nothing here is worth failing a tool call
 *   over, and stderr in an MCP server is the user's transcript.
 * - **Do nothing unless asked.** It is off unless the manifest sets
 *   `JEV_PLUGIN_DAEMON=1`, so `npx jevwire` as a plain MCP server — no plugin,
 *   no hooks — never starts a daemon that would have no hooks to serve.
