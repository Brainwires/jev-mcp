/**
 * UserPromptSubmit: bookkeeping, and optionally a task classification.
 *
 * The bookkeeping is the important half and always runs, even with
 * `route_prompts` off and even with no API key. It is how every other hook
 * learns what the user asked for: a PreToolUse hook is handed a tool call, not
 * a request, and the transcript file has no documented format and lags the
 * conversation. Recording the prompt here is the supported way to know it.
 *
 * It also resets the stop-block counter, which is what makes "one block per
 * user prompt" mean what it says.
