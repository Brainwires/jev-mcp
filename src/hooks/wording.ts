 * injected context trips the model's own injection defenses, and a note that
 * reads as an order competes with the user instead of informing the agent. So
 * every line here:
 *
 *  - states what happened, in the past tense, rather than what to do;
 *  - names its source ("the jev classifier") and what that source could see;
 *  - says what the agent can do next only as a fact about this hook ("the call
 *    is re-runnable unchanged with …"), never as an instruction.
 *
 * `BANNED_IMPERATIVES` is enforced by `tests/hooks/wording.test.ts` over every
 * note and trip this file can produce.
