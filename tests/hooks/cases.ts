/**
 * One table of hook inputs, driven twice.
 *
 * `main.test.ts` runs it in process through `runEvent`, the way a command hook
 * does. `conformance.test.ts` posts it to a real daemon and asserts the reply is
 * byte-identical. That is the property 0.4.0 lives or dies on: the http hooks
 * and the command hooks must be the same plugin, not two implementations that
 * happen to agree today.
 *
 * Every case is deterministic. The models are `FakeModel`s built fresh per run
 * so both paths get the same answers, `now` is fixed by the driver, and nothing
 * in an expected string depends on wall-clock time — which is why there is no
 * trip-repeat case here (its text counts the seconds since the first deny). The
 * repeat path is covered in `pre-tool-use.test.ts`, where the clock is injected.
