/**
 * What the plugin says, and what it may not say.
 *
 * The negative half is the important one. Claude Code's docs are explicit that
 * imperative "system command" phrasing in injected context trips the model's
 * own injection defenses, and a note that gives orders is competing with the
 * user rather than informing the agent. So every sentence this plugin can hand
 * Claude is checked against `BANNED_IMPERATIVES`, and each template is checked
 * for the four facts it has to carry.
